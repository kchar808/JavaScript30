### Day 1: May 16, 2020
**Javascript Drum Kit**<br>
*Learned about* -
Key events, playing audio, and listening for the transitionend event.
keycode.info is a website that tells you what key code belongs to each key you hit.
If you call .play on an audio element that is already playing, it won't play it again. So you must rewind it to the start of the element (setting currentTime = 0).
Adding and removing classes to an element through classList.add and classList.remove.
